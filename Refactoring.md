# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

I began by improving the readability of the code by renaming variables and functions to be more descriptive. Next, I refactored the code to remove duplicate logic and unnecessary if statements, simplifying the code and making it easier to follow. In addition, I created new tests that covered other input scenarios to ensure that the code was working as expected. Finally, I reviewed the code and tests for readability, making adjustments to naming and commenting where necessary to improve clarity.
